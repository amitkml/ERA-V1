### Neural Architecture

In this code file, will explore more on how receptive field is calculated and how we can calculate input dimensions and weights

### Receptive Field (RF)

The Receptive Field (RF) is defined as the size of the region in the input that produces the feature[3]. Basically, it is a measure of association of an output feature (of any layer) to the input region (patch). Insight: The idea of receptive fields applies to local operations (i.e. convolution, pooling).
