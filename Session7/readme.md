# Assignment

1. Your new target is:
   1. 99.4% **(this must be consistently shown in your last few epochs, and not a one-time achievement)**
   2. Less than or equal to 15 Epochs
   3. Less than 8000 Parameters
   4. Do this using your modular code. Every model that you make must be there in the model.py file as Model_1, Model_2, etc.
2. Do this in exactly 3 steps
3. Each File must have a "target, result, analysis" TEXT block (either at the start or the end)
4. You must  convince why have you decided that your target should be what you have  decided it to be, and your analysis MUST be correct. 
5. Evaluation is highly subjective, and if you target anything out of the order, marks will be deducted. 
6. Explain your 3 steps using these **targets**, **results**, and **analysis** with **links** to your GitHub files (Colab files moved to GitHub). 
7. Keep Receptive field calculations handy for each of your models.
